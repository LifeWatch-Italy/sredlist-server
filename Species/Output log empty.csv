Species	Date	Parameter	Definition	Value
		Distribution_Source	"Source of the distribution map. Could be either ""Red List"" (if the last range map published in the Red List has been used), ""Uploaded"" (if you uploaded a range map on the platform), or ""Created"" (if you created a range map from occurrence data)"	
		Gbif_Source	"Source of occurrence data used to create a range map. Could include ""GBIF"" (automatic download from GBIF website), ""OBIS"" (automatic download from OBIS website), ""Red List"" (use of Red List occurrence points)"	
		Gbif_Year	Minimum year of observations. All observations made before this date have been removed from the occurrences	
		Gbif_Uncertainty	Maximum coordinate uncertainty. All observations with higher localisation uncertainty than this value (in km) will be removed. Only applies to GBIF / OBIS data	
		Gbif_Sea	Selection of land / sea data. 0= all observations kept; 1= only land observations are kept; 2= only observations at sea are kept	
		Gbif_Extent	"Filtering for a geographic extent. Removes observations outside these coordinates (min longitude, max longitude, min latitude, max latitude)"	
		Mapping_Start	First step of the mapping procedure to create a range map. 0= Minimum Convex Polygon around the points; 1= Kernel distribution; 2= Hydrobasins; 3= Hydrobasins overlapping with the Minimum Convex Polygon	
		Mapping_Buffer	A buffer of X km has been made around the first range	
		Mapping_Crop	Has the range been cropped to keep only land or sea. 0= Nothing has been cropped; 1= only land was kept; 2= only sea was kept	
		Mapping_Altitude	Minimum and maximum elevation allowed in the range	
		Mapping_Smooth	Smoothing parameter of the obtained range	
		Distribution_Presence	Presence parameters filtered in the Red List or uploaded distribution	
		Distribution_Origin	Origin parameters filtered in the Red List or uploaded distribution	
		Distribution_Seasonal	Seasonal parameters filtered in the Red List or uploaded distribution	
		AOH_HabitatPreference	Habitat preference used to calculate Area of Habitat	
		AOH_MarginalHabitatPreference	Marginal habitat preference used to calculate Area of Habitat (we calculate an AOH without them and one with them to provide the range of AOH)	
		AOH_ElevationPreference	Elevation preference used to calculate Area of Habitat	
		AOH_GenerationLength	Generation Length used to calculate trends in Area of Habitat	
		AOH_Density	Density (ind per km2) used to calculate population size
