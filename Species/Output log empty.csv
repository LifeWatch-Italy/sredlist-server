NA,NA,Distribution_Source,"Source of the distribution map.

NA,NA,Gbif_Extent,"Filtering for a geographic extent. Removes observations outside these coordinates (min longitude, max longitude, min latitude, max latitude)",NA
NA,NA,Gbif_yearBin,Exclude records with no year information (if equals “TRUE” this means that records with missing information were removed),NA
NA,NA,Gbif_uncertainBin,Exclude records with no coordinate uncertainty information (if equals “TRUE” this means that records with missing information were removed),NA
NA,NA,Mapping_Start,First step of the mapping procedure to create a range map. 'mcp'= Minimum Convex Polygon around occurence records - 'alpha'= Alphahull around occurrence records - 'kernel'= Kernel distribution – ‘indivsites’= Individual sites - 'hydro'=Hydrobasins with occurrence records - 'hydroMCP= Hydrobasins overlapping with the Minimum Convex Polygon around occurrence records,NA
NA,NA,Mapping_Buffer,A buffer of X km has been made around the first range,NA
NA,NA,Mapping_Crop,Has the range been cropped to keep only land or sea. cropland= Only land was kept (sea areas excluded) - cropsea= only sea was kept (land areas excluded),NA
NA,NA,Mapping_Altitude,Minimum and maximum elevation allowed in the range,NA
NA,NA,Mapping_Merge,Merge with published range map (if “TRUE” it means that the distribution created from occurrence records has been merged with the published range map),NA
NA,NA,Mapping_Smooth,Smoothing parameter of the obtained range,NA
NA,NA,Kernel_parameter,Value of the kernel parameter (only important if Kernel has been chosen as the method to map distribution with the Mapping_Start parameter,NA
NA,NA,Alpha_parameter,Value of the Alphahull parameter (only important if Alphahull has been chosen as the method to map distribution with the Mapping_Start parameter,NA
NA,NA,Distribution_Presence,Presence parameters filtered in the Red List or uploaded distribution,NA
NA,NA,Distribution_Origin,Origin parameters filtered in the Red List or uploaded distribution,NA
NA,NA,Distribution_Seasonal,Seasonal parameters filtered in the Red List or uploaded distribution,NA

NA,NA,AOH_HabitatPreference,Habitat preference used to calculate Area of Habitat,NA
NA,NA,AOH_MarginalHabitatPreference,Marginal habitat preference used to calculate Area of Habitat (we calculate an AOH without them and one with them to provide the range of AOH),NA
NA,NA,AOH_ElevationPreference,Elevation preference used to calculate Area of Habitat,NA
NA,NA,AOH_GenerationLength,Generation Length used to calculate trends in Area of Habitat,NA
