For the whole process on the platform you used as polygon distribution `r revalue(outlog$Value[outlog$Parameter=="Distribution_Source"], c("Red List"="the distribution that was published with the last Red List assessment", "Uploaded"="a distribution map that was uploaded on the platform", "StoredOnPlatform"="a distribution map that was previously created on the platform from occurrence records"))`.
You then filtered the distribution, keeping only presence codes `r outlog$Value[outlog$Parameter == "Distribution_Presence"]`, origin codes `r outlog$Value[outlog$Parameter == "Distribution_Origin"]`, and seasonal codes `r outlog$Value[outlog$Parameter == "Distribution_Seasonal"]`.

`r ifelse(is.na(outlog$Value[outlog$Parameter=="Crop_Country"]), "", paste0("You only kept the part of the distribution that is included in ", outlog$Value[outlog$Parameter=="Crop_Country"], " (National Red Listing option)."))` 

The distribution map used along the assessment was the following:

![](`r paste0(outDir, '/Plots/plot_dist.png')`){width=800px}
